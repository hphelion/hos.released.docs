        <section>
            <title>Object Storage (Swift)</title>
            <p><!-- DOCS-2491 --> Swift has revised their node removal process to use an easier
                method using pass-through. For more information, see <xref
                    href="operations/objectstorage/removing_swift_node.dita"/>.</p>
            <p><!-- DOCS-2554 --> Swift has revised the <codeph>min-part-time</codeph> parameter and
                updated it to <codeph>min-part-hours</codeph> which is in-line with upstream
                OpenStack. See <xref href="operations/objectstorage/swift_min_part_hours.dita"/> for
                more details.</p>
            <p><!-- DOCS-2673 --> Updated process for determining which node in your environment
                should be used for Swift ring building. In previous versions this was done on the
                first Swift proxy server. In <keyword keyref="kw-hos-version-30"/> this will now be
                done on the Swift ring building server. <xref
                    href="operations/troubleshooting/objectstorage/identify_ring_builder.dita"
                />.</p>
            <p><!-- DOCS-2674, DOCS-2672, DOCS-2670 --> Swift has added support for erasure coded
                rings. For more information, see <xref
                    href="administration/objectstorage/storage_policies.dita"/>, <xref
                    href="operations/objectstorage/add_new_storage_policy.dita"/>, <xref
                    href="administration/objectstorage/ring_specifications.dita"/>.</p>
            <p><!-- DOCS-2554 --> Swift has added support for zones, which are similar to
                availability zones in the Nova service. For more details, see <xref
                    href="administration/objectstorage/swift_zones.dita"/> and <xref
                    href="operations/objectstorage/changing_swift_zone.dita"/>.</p>
        </section>

        <section><title>Block Storage - Ceph</title>
            <p>In <keyword keyref="kw-hos-version-30"/>, the Entry-scale KVM with Ceph model uses
                the three network setup in the example configuration. For more details, see <xref
                    href="architecture/examples/entryscale_kvm_ceph_threenetwork.dita"/>.</p>
            <p>The Entry-scale KVM with Ceph model also uses the Ceph RADOS gateway which allows
                Ceph to be used for both block and object storage.</p>
            <p><!-- DOCS-2832 -->In <keyword keyref="kw-hos-version-30"/>, Ceph OSD disks are
                referred to by UUID instead of by block device name, which is what previous versions
                used. For more details, see <xref
                    href="operations/troubleshooting/ts_ceph.dita#troubleshooting_ceph/issue8"
                />.</p>

            </p>
            <!-- DOCS-2709 -->
            <p id="new_feature_dns">DNS Service is based on the OpenStack Designate API. The new DNS Service provides
                several different backends and is installed as part of <keyword
                    keyref="kw-hos-phrase-30"/> versus installation by a separate installer as in
                previous versions of <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>. It requires configuration before
                the <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase-30"/> installation, therefore please refer to the
                    <xref
                    href="installation/designate/designate_install_overview.dita#DesignateInstallOverview"
                /> for instructions on how to setup and configure the DNS Service. </p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Keystone to Keystone Federation</title>
            <!-- DOCS-2936 - release note edit via Tim Cuddy -->
            <p>Identity federation enables the ability to configure <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> to
                use existing identity management systems like a LDAP directory to be used as the
                source of user access authentication. The Keystone to Keystone Federation (K2K)
                function extends this concept for accessing resources in multiple, separate <keyword
                    keyref="kw-hos"/> clouds. Each cloud can be configured to trust the
                authentication credentials of other clouds to provide the ability for a user to
                authenticate with their home cloud and access authorized resources in another cloud
                without having to re-authenticate with the remote cloud.</p>
        </section>

        <section><title>Key Management with Barbican</title><p id="new_feature_barbican">Barbican is an OpenStack key
                management service offering secure storage, provisioning, and management of key
                data. The Barbican service provides management of secrets, keys and certificates via
                multiple storage back ends. Barbican supports symmetric and asymmetric key
                generation using various algorithms and has two types of core feature sets: the
                Barbican component, which exposes a REST API for secrets/containers/orders and
                Barbican workers for asynchronous order processing.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="rbac">
            <title>Role-based Access Control (RBAC) Networking Support </title><p>The RBAC feature
                in this release enables better security as administrators can now control who has
                access to specific networks, which represents a significant improvement over the
                previous all-or-nothing approach to shared networks. </p></section>
        <section id="adminRoles">
            <title>Separate Service Administrator Role</title><p>Each OpenStack service account now
                has an optional role available to restrict the OpenStack functions each account can
                access. This feature enables cloud administrators to apply service-specific
                role-based, admin-level access to a specific UserID, with the ability to audit
                admin-level actions. See <xref
                    href="security/admin_role_segregation.dita#roleSegregation"/> for more
                information.</p></section>
        <section id="interservicePasswords">
            <title>Inter-service Password Enhancements</title><p>Now you can conveniently change the
                inter-service passwords used for authenticating communications between services in
                your HPE Helion cloud deployment, promoting better compliance with your
                organizationâ€™s security policies. </p></section>
        <section id="red_hat">
            <title>SELinux for Red Hat KVM </title><p>SELinux (also known as Security-Enhanced
                Linux) provides enhanced security at the hypervisor layer on the compute nodes by
                mitigating the risk of hypervisor attacks and strongly isolating the guest VMs. It
                enforces mandatory access control security policies for the compute nodes (svirt
                process) running Red Hat KVM, thus reducing the risk of a hypervisor breakout. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="in_transit"><title>Data in Transit Protection via Configurable TLS for Internal
                API Endpoints</title><p> With <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>, data transmission
                between internal API endpoints is encrypted using TLS v 1.2 to protect sensitive
                data against unauthorized disclosure and modification (spoofing and tampering
                attacks). Additionally, you can configure TLS using your own certificates, from a
                Certificate Authority of your choice, providing deployment
            flexibility.</p></section>
        <section id="dataSecurity"><title>Data at Rest Protection using Project-based
                Encryption</title>
            <p>With this release you can encrypt sensitive data-at-rest on per tenant or project
                basis, while storing and managing keys externally and centrally using HPE ESKM. This
                capability requires the OpenStack Barbican API and OASIS KMIP (Key Management
                Interoperability Protocol) plugins for integration, and supports encryption of
                Cinder block storage with <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>. </p></section>
        <section id="cadf"><title>CADF-compliant Security Audit Logs</title><p>Security audit logs
                for critical services such as identity, compute, block storage, the image service,
                orchestration, networking, etc. are available in a standard CADF (Cloud Audit Data
                Federation) format. These logs contain information on events such as unauthorized
                logins, admin level access, unsuccessful login attempts, and anomalous deletion of
                VMs etc. that are critical from a security threat monitoring standpoint.
            </p></section>
        <section id="pciReady">
            <title>PCI Readiness</title><p>
                <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> is now PCI (Payment Card Industry) ready, enabling
                retail and finance industries that are subject to PCI compliance, to become
                certified. The readiness is based on lab assessment and verification conducted by an
                external audit firm, against the more than 250 security requirements specified in
                the PCI DSS (Data Security Standard) v3.1 standards document. </p></section>
        <section id="mtuConfig">
            <title>MTU Configurabiity</title><p> In <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> you can
                configure maximum transmission units (MTUs) in a number of places. MTU can be set as
                an attribute of a network group in network_groups.yml (this applies only to KVM),
                assigning every network in the network group the specified MTU. For more
                information, see <xref href="networking/configure_mtu.dita#configureMTU"
            />.</p></section>

        <section><title>IP Address Management</title><p>Starting with this release, HPE Helion
                OpenStack networking includes a pluggable interface for the IP Address Management
                (IPAM) function. This interface creates a driver framework for the allocation and
                de-allocation of subnets and IP addresses, enabling the integration of alternate
                IPAM implementations or third-party IP Address Management systems.</p>
        </section>
        <section><title>Provider Network Support</title><p>A provider network is a virtual network
                created in the HPE Helion OpenStack cloud that is consumed by Helion services. A
                benefit of a provider network is that it does not create a virtual router; rather,
                it depends on L3 routing that is provided by the infrastructure. A provider network
                can easily be created by adding the specification to the HPE Helion OpenStack input
                model. </p></section>
        <section><title>L2 Gateway Agent </title><p>The L2 gateway agent is an interoperable SDN
                (Software-Defined Networking) and network virtualization solution. The agent allows
                users to leverage their physical and virtual network to work together as a single
                entity, thus eliminating the manual network configuration, which is time consuming
                and error prone.</p>
