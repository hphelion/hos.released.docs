            <title>Overview</title>
            <p>Ceph is a distributed object storage solution which can horizontally scale up to
                multiple petabytes of storage and is fundamentally based on a reliable autonomic
                distributed object store (RADOS) object-based storage system. <keyword
                    keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> supports and utilizes the Firefly version of Ceph. Ceph
                stores all data as objects, however, it provides various optional components which
                act as a gateways to support different storage protocols. For example, RBD (RADOS
                Block Device) provides support for the block storage protocol, and the RADOS Gateway
                provides support for the S3/Swift API protocol for object storage access.</p>
            <p>The salient features of Ceph are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware Agnostic - Use of any commodity hardware.</li>
                <li>Scalable - Scales horizontally up to multiple petabytes (there is no theoretical
                    limit).</li>
                <li>Self healing, self managing.</li>
                <li>High Availability - No single point of failure.</li>
                <li>Supports various client protocols for block device access, object storage access
                    using S3/Swift API etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ceph is flexible in its deployment. Though all data are stored as objects, Ceph can
                be configured with optional components that provide access to the data through
                multiple storage protocols. The addition of such components should only be done if
                use of the related storage protocol is necessary. For example: If you are not going
                to support the S3/Swift protocol then deployment of the RADOS gateway is not
                necessary. </p>
            <p>For easy readability, this documentation is categorized into sections that
                segregate<!--is categorized into sections to segregate--> the various aspects of a
                Ceph cluster deployment. For instance, the topics describing hardware configuration,
                service configuration parameters, and deployment architecture are categorized into
                separate sections. In keeping with this sub-component organization, each major
                section is further categorized into following subsections: <ul id="ul_enh_4sp_kw">
                    <li>Core Ceph</li>
                    <li>RADOS gateway</li>
                </ul></p>
            <p>Also, in each section we describe recommended vs. supported configurations. We
                encourage the use of our recommended configurations whenever possible, although the
                supported configurations are fully tested and validated. The supported configuration
                should be used in place of the recommended configuration only when necessary, and a
                thorough assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of each option should be performed
                before choosing a supported configuration rather than a recommended one.</p>

            <p><b>RADOS Gateway</b></p>
            <p>The RADOS Gateway service is an object storage interface that allows an end user to
                perform HTTP-based CRUD operations on an object. It supports both the OpenStack
                Swift and Amazon S3 REST APIs. Note that unlike other OpenStack services which rely
                solely on the Keystone component for user management, RADOS Gateway uses the
                following users and user management services: (see more details at <xref
                    href="usage_ceph_storage_helion.dita#config_ceph/rados-gw-object-storage">Use

                <li>RADOS Gateway user (managed by Ceph itself and does not require Keystone)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>RADOS Gateway is an optional component. We advise deploying RADOS Gateway only if you
                need to access your object storage using the Swift or S3 API. Features of RADOS
                Gateway are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>RADOS Gateway is configured to run in a simple (non-federated or single region)
                    mode. </li>
                <li>The HAProxy on the <keyword keyref="kw-hos-tm"/> controller node acts as a load
                    balancer (in least connection mode, the load balancer selects the server with
                    the least number of connections) for RADOS Gateway servers. </li>
                <li>Provides OpenStack Keystone integration (users with the appropriate roles can
                    access Swift APIs served by <codeph>radosgw</codeph>). </li>

                    on standalone nodes. </li>
                <li>Amazon S3 APIs can be accessed only by RADOS Gateway users. </li>
                <li>The RADOS Gateway external and internal endpoints are SSL/TLS enabled, including
                    the public endpoints represented by HAProxy.</li>

            <title>Deployment Architecture</title>
            <p>The following points needs to be considered for Ceph deployment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ceph networking </li>
                <li>Placement of service components (like OSD, monitor, RADOS Gateway) across nodes.
                    For example, the RADOS Gateway and monitor components can be deployed on
                    standalone nodes or together on the same node</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Ceph networking</b></p>
            <p>Rather than routing requests to a specific gateway for storage operations, Ceph
                clients transmit traffic directly to OSD daemons. OSD daemons perform data
                replication and participate in recovery activities. In general, a Ceph storage pool
                is configured to maintain 3 replicas of any stored object. This can result in a
                large amount of network traffic as the daemons maintain up-to-date versions of the
                object replicas. A single transaction on an object in a Ceph storage pool results in
                3 times the initial transaction traffic as the 3 replicas are kept in a consistent
                state. Therefore, a 4 MB write transaction results in 12 MB (4MB * 3 replicas) of
                network data movement in the Ceph clusters. In addition, a Ceph cluster is
                communicative by design, resulting in an abundance of network traffic. Considering
                these points, it is very important to segregate various Ceph data traffic. The Ceph
                data traffic is categorized into three segments: <ul id="ul_iqq_shn_fw">
                    <li>Management traffic: monitoring, logging etc </li>
                    <li>Client traffic (often termed as data traffic): client requests sent to OSD
                        daemons </li>
                    <li>Cluster traffic (often termed as replication traffic): data replication and
                        recovery traffic among OSD daemons.</li>
                </ul></p><p>For a high performance cluster, proper network configuration is very important. Segregate
                different categories of traffic on separate networks. For a cluster of reasonable
                size (a few TBs), it is recommended to have a cluster with at least two networks,
                i.e., a single network for management and client data traffic (front-side) and a
                second network for cluster traffic (back-side). For a large Ceph cluster, we
                recommended segregating each traffic category onto its own network. Segregating
                network traffic also provides for a more secure environment, as the network for
                cluster traffic does not require direct internet connectivity. Apart from the
                virtual separation of networks (using VLANs), we need to consider the physical NICs
                used for Ceph servers as well. We strongly recommend the use of bonded NICs to
                provide redundancy and prevent a single point of failure. Please note the difference
                between network separation through the use of VLANs and through the use of separate
                NICs. In a multi-network model, network segregation through VLANs should be
                prioritized and ideally complimented by NIC separation. Please see below for our
                recommended order of priority for the method of network segregation: <ol
                    id="ol_dwc_rbl_jw">
                    <li>Separation of VLAN</li>
                    <li>Separation of NIC for VLANs.</li>
                </ol> The network architecture that you choose will depend on how many NICs you
                have. As stated earlier, we recommend using bonded interfaces when possible. The
                following configuration examples may help you choose your preferred setup: <ol
                    id="ol_ssd_tbl_jw">
                    <li>6 NICs configured as 3 bonded interfaces: The first bonded interface for the
                        management traffic VLAN, the second for OSD client traffic VLAN, and the
                        third for OSD internal traffic VLAN (ideally
                        preferred<!--, will done by very few customers hosting very large ceph clusters-->) </li>
                    <li>4 NICs configured as 2 bonded interfaces: First bonded interface is a member
                        of the Management traffic VLAN while the second interface is a member of the
                        Client traffic and Cluster traffic VLANs (mostly
                        used<!-- practical pattern followed. I'm unclear on which networks share an interface-->) </li>
                    <li>2 NICs configured as one bonded interface: Interface is a member of all
                        VLANs (<!--pattern followed in cases where we have--> for a few NICs
                        only)</li>
                </ol></p><p><keyword keyref="kw-hos-tm"/>Ceph software offers significant flexibility when defining and

                            or a combination of above. For a large cluster, you can use a separate
                            bonded interface which in turn necessiates the need to have at least 6
                            NICs for OSD nodes and 4 NICs for monitor nodes.</p></li>
