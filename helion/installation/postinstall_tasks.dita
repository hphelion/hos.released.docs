    <section id="creds"><title>Determining Your User Credentials</title>
      <note type="important">At this time it is not possible to change the default administrator
        password without causing errors in your deployment so we do not recommend changing the
        default password.</note>
      <p>On your lifecycle manager, in the
          <codeph>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/group_vars/</codeph> directory you will find
        several files. In the one labeled as first control plane node you can locate the user
        credentials for both the Administrator user (<codeph>admin</codeph>) and your Demo user
          (<codeph>demo</codeph>) which you will use to perform many other actions on your
        cloud.</p>
      <p>For example, if you are using the Entry-scale KVM with VSA model and used the default
        naming scheme given in the example configuration files, you can use these commands on your
        lifecycle manager to GREP for your user credentials:</p>
      <p><b>Administrator</b></p>
      <codeblock>grep keystone_admin_pwd entry-scale-kvm-vsa-control-plane-1</codeblock>
      <p><b>Demo</b></p>
      <codeblock>grep keystone_demo_pwd entry-scale-kvm-vsa-control-plane-1</codeblock>
    </section>
    <section id="env_vars"><title>Setup Environment Variables</title>
      <p>This playbook will setup the proper environmental variables for your cloud so you can use
        command-line clients</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Run the following command, which will replace <codeph>/etc/hosts</codeph> on the
            deployer:</p>
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts cloud-client-setup.yml</codeblock>
          <p>As the <codeph>/etc/hosts</codeph> file no longer has entries for Helion lifecycle
            management, sudo commands may become a bit slower. To fix this issue, once this step is
            complete, add "hlm" after "127.0.0.1 localhost". The result will look like this:</p>
          <codeblock>...
# Localhost Information
127.0.0.1 localhost hlm</codeblock></li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="sshkeys"><title>Backup Your SSH Keys</title>
      <p>As part of the cloud deployment setup process, SSH keys to access the systems are generated
        and stored in <codeph>~/.ssh</codeph> on your lifecycle manager.</p>
      <p>These SSH keys allow access to the subsequently deployed systems and should be included in
        the list of content to be archived in any backup strategy.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="endpoints"><title>Retrieving Service Endpoints</title>
      <!--  TODO add some content here  <p>text</p>-->
      <ol>
        <li><p>From your lifecycle manager, source the admin creds setup during the
            installation:</p>
          <p><codeblock>unset OS_TENANT_NAME
source ~/keystone.osrc</codeblock></p></li>
        <li><p>Using the OpenStack command-line tool you can then query the Keystone service for
            your endpoints:</p>
          <p><codeblock>openstack endpoint list</codeblock></p>
          <note type="tip">You can use <codeph>openstack -h</codeph> to access the client help file
            and a full list of commands.</note></li>
      </ol>
