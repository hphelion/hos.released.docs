      <title>Performing the Upgrade from HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0 to 2.0.3</title>
      <note type="warning">The process for upgrading HPE Helion OpenStack to version 2.0.3 requires
        a reboot which may prevent core <b>HPE Helion Development Platform</b> services from
        restarting. If your environment relies on HPE Helion Development Platform, please follow
        instructions for the <xref href="/#devplatform/2.0/upgrade_HOS_21.html" format="html"
          scope="external">HPE Helion Development Platform upgrade process</xref>.</note>
      <p>When upgrading from HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0 to HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0.3 you will use the
        same configuration files in your <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition</codeph> directory as
        you used when originally installing the software.</p>
      <p>The configuration you specified will remain unchanged through the upgrade process;
          <b>however</b>, if you made any configuration changes by passing parameters to any Ansible
        playbooks using the <codeph>-e</codeph> option, you should find the affected files and make
        the required changes directly in the files in <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud</codeph> and commit
        them to the git repository so that those changes are tracked and applied during the upgrade
        process. Otherwise they will not be applied after the upgrade.</p>
      <p>You may also install from HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0.3 as a full install. Those instructions
        are found in the installation guide. See <xref href="installation_overview.dita"
          >Installation Overview</xref> for details. If you choose to do a fresh install it is
        important that you completely wipe your disks prior to performing the installation,
        otherwise errors may occur.</p>

      <title>DNS Service Restart for Helion Development Platform after All Node Reboots</title>
      <note>If you are running HPE Helion Development Platform and are upgrading HPE Helion
        OpenStack, you must restart your services after restarting all the nodes mentioned
        below.</note>
      <p>The following are the steps you will take to ensure that Helion Development Platform runs
        after the Helion OpenStack upgrade:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>SSH into the HPE Helion OpenStack lifecycle manager.
          <codeblock>ssh stack@&lt;dnsaas-deployer-ip></codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the following playbooks in this order.
          <codeblock>cd scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts designate-stop.yml
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts FND-CLU-start.yml

        gracefully shut down Helion Development Platform Services and instances.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mainSteps"><title>Upgrade Overview</title>
      <p>To perform the upgrade, the workflow will look something like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Run the upgrade to apply updates to all nodes in the cloud (including the node hosting
          the lifecycle manager itself), as per instructions below.</li>
        <li>Reboot all of the nodes in your cloud in order to take in the new kernel changes
          introduced in HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0.3. Instructions to reboot your cloud nodes are
          provided below.</li>
        <li>Note the additional step that is specifically required for upgrading clouds with ESX and
          a further additional step for ESX after all nodes are rebooted.</li>
        <!--<li>Note changes specific to anyone running HPE Helion Development Platform. Several of its
          services require special stopping and restarting.</li>-->

      <sectiondiv outputclass="insideSection">
        <p><b>Migrate Singleton Services First</b></p>
        <p>The first consideration before rebooting any controller nodes is that there are a few
          services that run as singletons (non-HA), thus they will be unavailable while the
          controller they run on is down. Typically this is a very small window, but if you want to
          retain the service during the reboot of that server you should take special action to
          maintain service, such as migrating the service.</p>
        <p>For these steps, if your singleton services are running on controller1 and you move them
          to controller2, then ensure you move them back to controller1 before proceeding to reboot
          controller2.</p>
        <p><b>For the <codeph>cinder-volume</codeph> singleton service:</b></p>
        <p>Execute the following command on each controller node to determine which node is hosting
          the cinder-volume singleton. It should be running on only one node: </p>
        <codeblock>ps auxww | grep cinder-volume | grep -v grep</codeblock>
        <p>Run the <codeph>cinder-migrate-volume.yml</codeph> playbook specifying the node to
          migrate to in the <codeph>migrate_host</codeph> argument:</p>
        <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible 
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts cinder-migrate-volume.yml --extra-vars "migrate_host=padawan-ccp-c1-m2-mgmt"</codeblock>
        <p>More details about the Cinder volume and backup migration instructions can be found in
            <xref href="../blockstorage/singleton_service_cinder.dita#topic_l1p_vpy_jt">Managing
            Cinder Volume and Backup Services</xref>.</p>
        <p><b>For the <codeph>nova-consoleauth</codeph> singleton service:</b></p>
        <p>The <codeph>nova-consoleauth</codeph> component runs by default on the first controller
          node, that is, the host with <codeph>consoleauth_host_index=0</codeph>. To move it to
          another controller node before rebooting controller 0, run the ansible playbook
            <codeph>nova-start.yml</codeph> and pass it the index of the next controller node. For
          example, to move it to controller 2 (index of 1), run:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts nova-start.yml --extra-vars "consoleauth_host_index=1"</codeblock></p>
        <p><b>Reboot the Controllers</b></p> In order to reboot the controller nodes, you must first
        retrieve a list of nodes in your cloud running control plane services. <codeblock>for i in $(grep -w cluster-prefix ~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/control_plane.yml | awk '{print $2}'); do grep $i ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/hosts/verb_hosts | grep ansible_ssh_host | awk '{print $1}'; done</codeblock>
        <p>Then perform the following steps from your lifecycle manager for each of your controller
          nodes:</p>
        <note type="warning">Any compute instances you have that don't have floating IP addresses
          associated with them will lose network connectivity while the controller nodes are
          rebooted.</note>
        <ol>
          <li>If any singleton services are active on this node, they will be unavailable while the
            node is down. If you want to retain the service during the reboot, you should take
            special action to maintain the service, such as migrating the service as appropriate as
            noted above.</li>
          <li>Stop all services on the controller node that you are rebooting first:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-stop.yml --limit &lt;controller node></codeblock></li>
          <li>Reboot the controller node, e.g. run the following command on the controller itself:
            <codeblock>sudo reboot  </codeblock></li>
          <li>Wait for the controller node to become ssh-able and allow an additional minimum of
            five minutes for the controller node to settle. Start all services on the controller
            node:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-start.yml --limit &lt;controller node></codeblock></li>
          <li>If you are using a shared controller/lifecycle manager, ensure that you restart apache
            on the lifecycle manager after the reboot using this
            command:<codeblock>sudo systemctl start apache2</codeblock></li>
          <li>Verify that the status of all services on that is OK on the controller node:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-status.yml --limit &lt;controller node></codeblock></li>
          <li>When above start operation has completed successfully, you may proceed to the next
            controller node. Ensure that you migrate your singleton services off the node
            first.</li>
        </ol>
        <note>It is important that you not begin the reboot procedure for a new controller node
          until the reboot of the previous controller node has been completed successfully (i.e. the
          hlm-status playbook has completed without error). </note>
        <note>If your system includes VSA nodes, rebooting a controller node will not re-start CMC
          as it is Java application. You will need to restart it.</note>

          <li>Identify all VSA nodes of a given cluster </li>
          <li>Pick one of the VSA nodes of the cluster and reboot it manually</li>
          <li>Check VSA VM's status :
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts vsa-status.yml --limit &lt;vsa_node name></codeblock></li>
          <li>Wait for VSA to come up, Check cluster status using CMC ( status should be
            "normal")</li>
          <li>Run the following command from your first controller node which will open the HP
            StoreVirtual Centralized Management Console (CMC) GUI
            <codeblock>/opt/HP/StoreVirtual/UI/jre/bin/java -jar /opt/HP/StoreVirtual/UI/UI.jar </codeblock></li>
          <li>To view the cluster status , go to: management group -&gt; click on the respective
            cluster -&gt; check for status</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 2-4 for the other remaining nodes of the same VSA cluster. </li>
          <li>Go to step 1 and repeat all steps for the other clusters.</li>

    <section id="reboot_ceph"><title outputclass="headerH">Rebooting Ceph Nodes</title>
      <sectiondiv outputclass="insideSection">
        <!--Note that Ceph has two components: <ul>
          <li>monitor nodes</li>
          <li>OSD nodes</li>
        </ul> If a monitor is deployed on controller node, then the rebooting sequence of the
        controller takes precedence over monitor nodes. You should reboot the group of nodes in
        specified order. For a given group (say controller or compute or VSA or ceph OSD etc),
        reboot should be done one-by-one, in series. For example, if there are three OSD nodes say
        OSD1, OSD2, OSD3 then you should reboot OSD1 and then OSD2 and so on.<ol>
          <li>Controller node (reboot of this will take care of the monitor as well) </li>
          <li>Compute node </li>
          <li>Standalone storage or dedicated storage, including: <ul>

              <li>VSA</li>
              <li>Ceph OSD</li>
              <li>Ceph monitor (if deployed on stand alone node). If monitor is deployed on
                controller node then rebooting sequence of controller takes precedence over monitor
                nodes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>More commonly, the monitor is deployed as a standalone; i.e., as separate set of
        resource nodes. In this case the reboot sequence will be: <ol>
          <li>Controller node </li>
          <li>Compute node </li>
          <li>Ceph monitor node </li>
          <li>Ceph OSD nodes </li>
        </ol> -->
        <p>There are two categories of ceph nodes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>monitor nodes</li>
          <li>OSD nodes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ceph nodes should be rebooted in their position in the overall sequence described in the
          reboot order section above.</p>
        <p>You should reboot both categories of ceph nodes in the order: monitor nodes, then OSD
          nodes. All ceph nodes should reboot one-by-one, in series. </p> If a monitor is deployed
        on controller node, then the rebooting sequence of the controller caters for the monitor
        nodes, so you need to additionally reboot only the OSD nodes. <p>If the monitor is deployed
          as a standalone; i.e., as separate set of resource nodes, you should reboot the monitor
          nodes before rebooting the OSD nodes.</p> For example, if there are three monitor nodes
        and three OSD nodes say, MON1, MON2 and MON3, with OSD1, OSD2, OSD3, then you should reboot
        MON1, then MON2 and then MON3 followed by OSD1, then OSD2 and so on In both cases, please
        ensure that you are serializing the reboot of a given family (monitor or OSD or controller);
        that is, don't reboot them all at the same time. This will ensure that each service is up
        and running and there is no impact on the client side. To reboot Ceph nodes, follow the
        sequence below to safely reboot the entire Ceph cluster: <ol>
          <li>Reboot a Ceph monitor node in the cluster. </li>
          <li>Once the monitor node comes up, wait for a minute and then execute the following
            command:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;monitor-hostname></codeblock>
          </li>
          <li>If the above playbook executes successfully, repeat from step 1 to reboot the next
            Ceph monitor node in the cluster. </li>
          <li>Once all the monitor nodes have been rebooted, execute
            <codeblock>ceph quorum_status </codeblock>on a monitor node and ensure that all the
            monitors have joined the quorum by observing that in the output, the "quorum_names"
            section lists all the monitors in the Ceph cluster. </li>
          <li>SSH to the Ceph OSD node to be rebooted and execute the following command to avoid the
            cluster rebalancing itself:<codeblock>ceph osd set noout</codeblock>
          </li>
          <li>Stop all the OSD services on the node by executing below command:
            <codeblock>sudo systemctl stop ceph-osd@*</codeblock></li>

          <li>You are going to need to verify that your OSD node has rebooted in the next step, so
            to do that you should SSH to one of your controller nodes and execute the command
            below:<codeblock>ceph -w</codeblock></li>

          <li>Now reboot the OSD node and monitor the output of the <codeph>ceph -w</codeph> command
            and when you see a line similar to <codeph>osd.0 192.17.11.7:6801/3824 boot</codeph>
            that is the sign that the reboot has completed. You can use CTRL + C to end the
            stream.</li>
          <li>Verify that all the OSDs on this node are up by executing following command (and
            observing that all the OSDs under the current host are reported as 'up')
            <codeblock>ceph osd tree</codeblock> If any of the OSDs are reported as 'down', please
            check the logs for the corresponding OSD (in the
              <codeph>/var/log/ceph/&lt;cluster-name>-osd.&lt;osd_number>.log</codeph> file) for
            resolving the issue. </li>
          <li>SSH to the rebooted OSD node and execute the following command to unset the cluster
            from noout : <codeblock>ceph osd unset noout</codeblock>
          </li>
          <li>From the lifecycle manager, execute the following playbook to check the status of the
            OSDs that have just come up:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;OSD-hostname></codeblock>
          </li>
          <li>If the above playbook does not report any errors, repeat from step 5 for another Ceph
            OSD node in the cluster. </li>
          <li>Once the entire cluster is rebooted, execute this command
            <codeblock>ceph health detail</codeblock> to ensure that you see HEALTH_OK. </li>
