    <p><i>A <uicontrol>server-role</uicontrol> identifies an
        <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol> that describes how its network interfaces are to
        be configured and used.</i>></p>
    <p>Networks are mapped onto specific network interfaces via an
        <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol>, which describes the network devices that need to
        be created (bonds, ovs-bridges, etc), their properties, and the
        <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> with which they are associated.</p>
    <p>An <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol> acts like a template; it can define how some or
        all of the <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> are to be mapped for a particular
        combination of physical NICs. However, it is the <uicontrol>service-components</uicontrol>
        on each server that determine which <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> are required and
        hence which interfaces and <uicontrol>networks</uicontrol> will be configured. This means
        that <uicontrol>interface-models</uicontrol> can be shared between different
        <uicontrol>server-roles</uicontrol>. For example, an API role and a database role may
        share an interface model even though they may have different disk models and they will
        require a different subset of the <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol>.</p>
    <p>Within an <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol>, physical ports are identified by a device
        name, which in turn is resolved to a physical port via a <uicontrol>nic-mapping</uicontrol>.
        To allow different physical servers to share an <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol>, the
        <uicontrol>nic-mapping</uicontrol> is defined as a property of each
        <uicontrol>server</uicontrol>.</p>
