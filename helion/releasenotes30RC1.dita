            <p>The installation instructions for Multipath Boot from SAN are available <xref keyref="multipath_boot_from_san">here</xref>.</p>
            <note type="important">Multipath Boot from SAN is not supported on "native" FCoE. Also, only LUNs 
                that are fully provisioned at the backend are supported. Some issues have been seen with Qlogic FC configurations and 
                these are currently being investigated. It is not recommended to use this configuration in RC1. (HLX-1762) </note>

            <title>Fixing Logrotate After Running Out Of Disk Space</title>
            <p>Improvements to the log rotation process provides more frequent checks to
                automatically warn customers if they are close to using 100% of the disk space.
                However, if a customer does run out of disk space on /var/log, then logrotate will
                start creating empty .1 files. These files will not be compressed because there is
                no more disk space. Freeing disk space will not fix logrotate. To fix logrotate, you
                will need to either compress all the *.l log files, or remove them.</p>
            <note type="important">Currently there are no plans to fix this because the improvements to the log rotation process make it less likely to run out of disk space. The improvements include running a check on disk space every 5 minutes (instead of once an hour in Helion OpenStack 2.0), and when it gets close to full (default value is 95%), running logrotate.</note>

<section><title>Rapidly Creating VMs</title>If creating large numbers of VMs in a synchronous manner
            (greater than 3 VMs per minute), VM creation failure of up to 10% may be experienced. To
            work around this behavior, lower the VM creation rate until consistent success is
            achieved. <!--docs-1050-->
