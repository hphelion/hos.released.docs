    <p>Before making major changes to your rings, you can see the planned layout of Swift rings
      using the following steps: <ol id="ol_icb_kgd_st">
        <li>Run the <codeph>swift-compare-model-rings.yml</codeph>
          playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-compare-model-rings.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Log onto the first node in the system that is running the swift-proxy-server process.
          (For more information, see <xref href="identify_ring_builder.dita#topic_rtc_s3t_mt"/>.)</li>
        <li>Run the following command to get the entire list drives and the actions planned for the
          rings:<codeblock>sudo swiftlm-ring-supervisor --make-delta --report --detail </codeblock></li>
        <li>Validate the following in the output: <ul id="ul_orc_r2b_kt">
            <li>Drives are being added to all rings in the ring specifications.</li>
            <li>Servers are being used as expected (for example, you may have a different set of
              servers for the account/container rings than the object rings.)</li>
            <li>The weight value is as expected. The weight value is the drive size expressed in GB
              (i.e., a 1 TB drive has a weight of 1024).</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ol></p>
