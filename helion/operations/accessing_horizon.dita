    <p>Horizon is the web GUI for administering your cloud deployment.</p>
    <note type="warning">Horizon uses the Keystone v3 API and you cannot and should not try 
      to revert to the Keystone v2 API for the Horizon service.</note>
    
    <section id="horizon"><title>Accessing Horizon</title>
      <p>If your administrator set a hostname value for <codeph>external_name</codeph> in your
          <codeph>network_groups.yml</codeph> file during the configuration process for your cloud
        then Horizon will be accessed over port 443 (https) on that hostname.</p>
      <p>If your administrator did not set a hostname value then in order to determine which IP
        address to use to access Horizon you can use this command from your lifecycle manager
        node:</p>
      <codeblock>grep vip-HZN-WEB /etc/hosts</codeblock>
      <p>The output of that command will show you the virtual IP address for Horizon that you should
        use.</p>
      <p>The default username for the Administrator user is <codeph>admin</codeph>. In order to find
        the randomized password that is created for this user you will need to look into the
          <codeph>~/service.osrc</codeph> file on the lifecycle manager. You can do that with
        this command:</p>
      <codeblock>cat ~/service.osrc</codeblock>
      <!--
      <note type="important">The credentials for your <codeph>admin</codeph> user account can be
        changed. See <xref href="../identity/identity_init.dita">Keystone Configuration</xref> for
        more details.</note>
