      <ol>
        <li>Reboot the Ceph monitor node.</li>
        <li>From the lifecycle manager, once the Ceph monitor node comes up, give it a minute and
          then execute the following playbook:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;monitor-hostname&gt;</codeblock></li>
        <li>If the playbook executes successfully, repeat the steps above for each Ceph monitor node
          that was rebooted.</li>
        <li>Once all the Ceph monitor nodes have been rebooted and are confirmed to be up then you
          need to execute the command below on each monitor node: <codeblock>ceph quorum_status</codeblock>
          <p>Ensure that all of the monitor nodes have joined the quorum by observing that in the
            output the <codeph>quorum_names</codeph> section lists all of the monitors in the Ceph
            cluster.</p></li>
        <li>Next, reboot the OSD node in the cluster.</li>
        <li>Once the OSD node comes up, wait around five minutes and then execute the following
          playbook:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;OSD-hostname&gt;</codeblock></li>
        <li>If the playbook executes successfully, repeat steps 5-6 for each OSD node in the
          cluster.</li>
        <li>Once the entire cluster is rebooted then execute the command below and observe that it
          is <codeph>HEALTH_OK</codeph>: <codeblock>ceph health details</codeblock></li>
      </ol>
