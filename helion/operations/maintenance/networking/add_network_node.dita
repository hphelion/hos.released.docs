      <p>If you are using the mid-scale model then your networking nodes are already separate and
        the roles are defined. If you are not already using this model and wish to add separate
        networking nodes then you need to ensure that those roles are defined. You can look in the
          <codeph>~/helion/examples</codeph> folder on your lifecycle manager for the mid-scale
        example model files which show how to do this.</p>
      <p>You should also have one or more baremetal servers that meet the minimum hardware
        requirements for a network node which are documented in the <xref href="../../../hardware.dita"
          >Hardware Support Matrix</xref>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="steps"><title>Adding a network node</title>
      <p>These steps will show you how to add the new network node to your
          <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file and then run the playbooks that update your cloud
        configuration. You will run these playbooks from the lifecycle manager.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to your lifecycle manager.</li>
        <li>Checkout the <codeph>site</codeph> branch of your local git so you can begin to make the
          necessary edits:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data
git checkout site</codeblock></li>
        <li>In the same directory, edit your <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file to include the
          details about your new network node(s). <p>For example, if you already had a cluster of
            three network nodes and needed to add a fourth one you would add your details to the
            bottom of the file in this format:</p>
          <codeblock># network nodes
- id: neut3
  ip-addr: 10.13.111.137
  role: NEUTRON-ROLE
  server-group: RACK2
  mac-addr: "5c:b9:01:89:b6:18"
  nic-mapping: HP-DL360-6PORT
  ip-addr: 10.243.140.22
  ilo-ip: 10.1.12.91
  ilo-password: password
  ilo-user: admin</codeblock>
          <note type="important">You will need to verify that the <codeph>ip-addr</codeph> value you
            choose for this node does not conflict with any other IP address in your cloud
            environment. You can confirm this by checking the
              <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/info/address_info.yml</codeph> file on your lifecycle
            manager.</note>
        </li>
        <li>In your <codeph>control_plane.yml</codeph> file you will need to check the values for
            <codeph>member-count</codeph>, <codeph>min-count</codeph>, and
            <codeph>max-count</codeph>, if you specified them, to ensure that they match up with
          your new total node count. So for example, if you had previously specified
            <codeph>member-count: 3</codeph> and are adding a fourth network node, you will need to
          change that value to <codeph>member-count: 4</codeph>.</li>
        <li>Commit the changes to git:
          <codeblock>git commit -a -m "Add new networking node &lt;name>"</codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the configuration processor:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Update your deployment directory:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Add the new node into Cobbler:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost cobbler-deploy.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Then you can image the node: <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost bm-reimage.yml -e nodelist=&#60;hostname></codeblock>
          <note>If you don't know the <codeph>&lt;hostname></codeph> already, you can get it by
            using <codeph>sudo cobbler system list</codeph></note></li>
        <li>[OPTIONAL] - Run the <codeph>wipe_disks.yml</codeph> playbook to ensure all of your
          partitions on your nodes are completely wiped prior to continuing with the installation:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts wipe_disks.yml --limit &#60;hostname></codeblock></li>
        <li>Configure the operating system on the new networking node with this playbook:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts osconfig-run.yml --limit &lt;hostname></codeblock></li>
        <li>Complete the networking node deployment with this playbook:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-deploy.yml --limit &#60;hostname></codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the <codeph>site.yml</codeph> playbook with the required tag so that all other
          services become aware of the new node:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts site.yml --tags "generate_hosts_file"</codeblock></li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you want to add a new networking node to the monitoring service checks, there is an
        additional playbook that must be run to ensure this happens:</p>
      <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts monasca-deploy.yml --tags "active_ping_checks"</codeblock>
