      <title>Recommended Node Reboot Order</title>
      <p>To ensure that rebooted nodes reintegrate into the cluster, the key is having enough time
        between controller reboots.</p>
      <p>The recommended way to achieve this is as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reboot controller nodes one-by-one with a suitable interval in between. If you alternate
          between controllers and compute nodes you will gain more time between the controller
          reboots. </li>
        <li>Reboot of compute nodes (if present in your cloud).</li>
        <li>Reboot of Swift nodes (if present in your cloud).</li>
        <li>Reboot of VSA nodes (if present in your cloud)</li>
        <li>Reboot of Ceph nodes (if present in your cloud).</li>
        <li>Reboot of ESX nodes (if present in your cloud).</li>

      <sectiondiv outputclass="insideSection">
        <p><b>Migrate Singleton Services First</b></p>
        <note>If you have previously rebooted your lifecycle manager for any reason, ensure that the
          apache2 service is running before continuing. To start the apache2 service, use this
          command: <codeblock>sudo systemctl start apache2 </codeblock></note>
        <p>The first consideration before rebooting any controller nodes is that there are a few
          services that run as singletons (non-HA), thus they will be unavailable while the
          controller they run on is down. Typically this is a very small window, but if you want to
          retain the service during the reboot of that server you should take special action to
          maintain service, such as migrating the service.</p>
        <p>For these steps, if your singleton services are running on controller1 and you move them
          to controller2, then ensure you move them back to controller1 before proceeding to reboot
          controller2.</p>
        <p><b>For the <codeph>cinder-volume</codeph> singleton service:</b></p>
        <p>Execute the following command on each controller node to determine which node is hosting
          the cinder-volume singleton. It should be running on only one node: </p>
        <codeblock>ps auxww | grep cinder-volume | grep -v grep</codeblock>
        <p>Run the <codeph>cinder-migrate-volume.yml</codeph> playbook - details about the Cinder
          volume and backup migration instructions can be found in <xref
            href="../blockstorage/singleton_service_cinder.dita">Managing Cinder Volume and Backup
            Services</xref>.</p>
        <p><b>For the <codeph>nova-consoleauth</codeph> singleton service:</b></p>
        <p>The <codeph>nova-consoleauth</codeph> component runs by default on the first controller
          node, that is, the host with <codeph>consoleauth_host_index=0</codeph>. To move it to
          another controller node before rebooting controller 0, run the ansible playbook
            <codeph>nova-start.yml</codeph> and pass it the index of the next controller node. For
          example, to move it to controller 2 (index of 1), run:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts nova-start.yml --extra-vars "consoleauth_host_index=1"</codeblock></p>
        <note>For the <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> versions prior to 2.1.2, manually stop the
            <codeph>nova-consoleauth</codeph> service on the node which is going to reboot after
          moving the service to a different controller via the Ansible playbook above. Use
            <codeph>sudo systemctl stop nova-consoleauth</codeph> to stop the service
          manually.</note>
        <p><b>Reboot the Controllers</b></p>
        <p>In order to reboot the controller nodes, you must first retrieve a list of nodes in your
          cloud running control plane services.</p>
        <codeblock>for i in $(grep -w cluster-prefix ~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/control_plane.yml | awk '{print $2}'); do grep $i ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/hosts/verb_hosts | grep ansible_ssh_host | awk '{print $1}'; done</codeblock>
        <p>Then perform the following steps from your lifecycle manager for each of your controller
          nodes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If any singleton services are active on this node, they will be unavailable while the
            node is down. If you want to retain the service during the reboot, you should take
            special action to maintain the service, such as migrating the service as appropriate as
            noted above.</li>
          <li>Stop all services on the controller node that you are rebooting first:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-stop.yml --limit &lt;controller node></codeblock></li>
          <li>Reboot the controller node, e.g. run the following command on the controller itself:
              <codeblock>sudo reboot</codeblock><p>Note that the current node being rebooted could
              be hosting the lifecycle manager.</p></li>
          <li>Wait for the controller node to become ssh-able and allow an additional minimum of
            five minutes for the controller node to settle. Start all services on the controller
            node:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-start.yml --limit &lt;controller node></codeblock></li>
          <li>Verify that the status of all services on that is OK on the controller node:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-status.yml --limit &lt;controller node></codeblock></li>
          <li>When above start operation has completed successfully, you may proceed to the next
            controller node. Ensure that you migrate your singleton services off the node
            first.</li>
        </ol>
        <note>It is important that you not begin the reboot procedure for a new controller node
          until the reboot of the previous controller node has been completed successfully (i.e. the
          hlm-status playbook has completed without error). </note>
        <note>If your system includes VSA nodes, rebooting a controller node will not re-start CMC
          as it is Java application. You will need to restart it.</note>

    <section id="rebootCompute"><title outputclass="headerH">Rebooting Compute Nodes</title>
      <sectiondiv outputclass="insideSection">
        <p>To reboot a compute node the following operations will need to be performed:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Disable provisioning of the node to take the node offline to prevent further instances
            being scheduled to the node during the reboot. </li>
          <li>Identify instances that exist on the compute node, and then either: <ul>
              <li>Live migrate the instances off the node before actioning the reboot. OR </li>
              <li>Stop the instances</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>Reboot the node </li>
          <li>Restart the Nova services </li>

        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Disable provisioning:

            the node has existing instances running on it these instances will need to be migrated
            or stopped prior to re-booting the node.</li>
          <li> Live migrate existing instances. Identify the instances on the compute node. Note:
            The following command must be run with nova admin
            credentials.<codeblock>nova list --host &lt;hostname&gt; --all-tenants</codeblock></li>
          <li> Migrate or Stop the instances on the compute node. <p> Migrate the instances off the
              node by running one of the following commands for each of the instances:</p><p>If your
              instance is booted from a volume and has any number of Cinder volume attached, use the
              nova live-migration
            command:</p><codeblock>nova live-migration &lt;instance uuid&gt; [&lt;target compute host&gt;]</codeblock>
            If your instance has local (ephemeral) disk(s) only, you can use the --block-migrate
            option:<codeblock>nova live-migration --block-migrate &lt;instance uuid&gt; [&lt;target compute host&gt;]</codeblock>
            Note: The [&lt;target compute host&gt;] option is optional. If you do not specify a
            target host then the nova scheduler will choose a node for you.<p>OR</p><p>Stop the
              instances on the node by running the following command for each of the
            instances:</p><codeblock>nova stop &lt;instance-uuid&gt;</codeblock></li>
          <li>Stop all services on the Compute node:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-stop.yml --limit &lt;compute node></codeblock></li>
          <li>SSH to your Compute nodes and reboot them: <codeblock>sudo reboot</codeblock><p>The
              operating system cleanly shuts down services and then automatically reboots. If you
              want to be very thorough, run your backup jobs just before you reboot.</p></li>
          <li>Run the hlm-start.yml playbook from the lifecycle manager. If needed, use the
            bm-power-up.yml playbook to restart the node. Specify just the node(s) you want to start
            in the 'nodelist' parameter arguments, i.e.
            nodelist=&lt;node1&gt;[,&lt;node2&gt;][,&lt;node3&gt;].<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost bm-power-up.yml -e nodelist=&lt;compute node></codeblock></li>
          <li>Execute the <b>hlm-start.yml </b>playbook. Specifying the node(s) you want to start in
            the 'limit' parameter arguments. This parameter accepts wildcard arguments and also
            '@&lt;filename>' to process all hosts listed in the file.

    <section id="reboot_ceph"><title outputclass="headerH">Rebooting Ceph</title>
      <sectiondiv outputclass="insideSection">
        <!--Note that Ceph has two components: <ul>
          <li>monitor nodes</li>
          <li>OSD nodes</li>
        </ul> If a monitor is deployed on controller node, then the rebooting sequence of the
        controller takes precedence over monitor nodes. You should reboot the group of nodes in
        specified order. For a given group (say controller or compute or VSA or ceph OSD etc),
        reboot should be done one-by-one, in series. For example, if there are three OSD nodes say
        OSD1, OSD2, OSD3 then you should reboot OSD1 and then OSD2 and so on.<ol>
          <li>Controller node (reboot of this will take care of the monitor as well) </li>
          <li>Compute node </li>
          <li>Standalone storage or dedicated storage, including: <ul>
          
              <li>VSA</li>
              <li>Ceph OSD</li>
              <li>Ceph monitor (if deployed on stand alone node). If monitor is deployed on
                controller node then rebooting sequence of controller takes precedence over monitor
                nodes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>More commonly, the monitor is deployed as a standalone; i.e., as separate set of
        resource nodes. In this case the reboot sequence will be: <ol>
          <li>Controller node </li>
          <li>Compute node </li>
          <li>Ceph monitor node </li>
          <li>Ceph OSD nodes </li>
        </ol> -->
        <p>There are two categories of ceph nodes:</p><ul>
          <li>monitor nodes</li>
          <li>OSD nodes</li>
        </ul><p>Ceph nodes should be rebooted in their position in the overall sequence described in
          the reboot order section above.</p><p>You should reboot both categories of ceph nodes in
          the order: monitor nodes, then OSD nodes. All ceph nodes should reboot one-by-one, in
          series. </p> If a monitor is deployed on controller node, then the rebooting sequence of
        the controller caters for the monitor nodes, so you need to additionally reboot only the OSD
        nodes. <p>If the monitor is deployed as a standalone; i.e., as separate set of resource
          nodes, you should reboot the monitor nodes before rebooting the OSD nodes.</p> For
        example, if there are three monitor nodes and three OSD nodes say, MON1, MON2 and MON3, with
        OSD1, OSD2, OSD3, then you should reboot MON1, then MON2 and then MON3 followed by OSD1,
        then OSD2 and so on In both cases, please ensure that you are serializing the reboot of a
        given family (monitor or OSD or controller); that is, don't reboot them all at the same
        time. This will ensure that each service is up and running and there is no impact on the
        client side. To reboot Ceph nodes, follow the sequence below to safely reboot the entire
        Ceph cluster: <ol>
          <li>Reboot a Ceph monitor node in the cluster. </li>
          <li>Once the monitor node comes up, wait for a minute and then execute the following
            command:
            <codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;monitor-hostname></codeblock></li>
          <li>If the above playbook executes successfully, repeat from step 1 to reboot the next
            Ceph monitor node in the cluster. </li>
          <li>Once all the monitor nodes have been rebooted, execute
            <codeblock>ceph quorum_status </codeblock>on a monitor node and ensure that all the
            monitors have joined the quorum by observing that in the output, the "quorum_names"
            section lists all the monitors in the Ceph cluster. </li>
          <li>Login to the OSD node to be rebooted and execute the following command to avoid the
            cluster rebalancing itself: <codeblock>ceph osd set noout</codeblock></li>
          <li>Stop all the OSD services on the current node by executing below command:
            <codeblock>sudo systemctl stop  ceph-osd@*</codeblock></li>
          <li>Now reboot the OSD node. </li>
          <li>Once the OSD node is up, log in and execute the following command and observe that a
            line similar to "osd.0 192.17.11.7:6801/3824 boot" appears for all the OSDs on the node:
            <codeblock>ceph -w</codeblock> To quit, this command press Ctrl + C </li>
          <li>Verify that all the OSDs on this node are 'up' by executing following command (and
            observing that all the OSDs under the current host are reported as 'up')
            <codeblock>ceph osd tree</codeblock> If any of the OSDs are reported as 'down', please
            check the logs for the corresponding OSD (in the
              <codeph>/var/log/ceph/&lt;cluster-name>-osd.&lt;osd_number>.log</codeph> file) for
            resolving the issue. </li>
          <li>Now execute the following command from the re-booted OSD node, to unset the cluster
            from noout : <codeblock>ceph osd unset noout</codeblock></li>
          <li>Execute the following playbook from the lifecycle manager node to check the status of
            the OSDs that have just come up:
            <codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;OSD-hostname></codeblock></li>
          <li>If the above playbook does not report any errors, repeat from step 5 for another Ceph
            OSD node in the cluster. </li>
          <li>Once the entire cluster is rebooted, execute this command
            <codeblock>ceph health detail</codeblock> to ensure that you see HEALTH_OK. </li>
