    <p conkeyref="HOS-conrefs/applies-to"/>
    <p>A typical <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> cloud consists of multiple servers which makes locating
      a specific log from a single server difficult. The <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Centralized
      Logging feature helps the administrator triage and troubleshoot the distributed cloud
      deployment from a single location.</p>
    <p>The Centralized Logging feature collects logs on a central system, rather than leaving the
      logs scattered across the network. The administrator can use a single Kibana interface to view
      log information in charts, graphs, tables, histograms, and other forms.</p>
    <p>In addition to each of the <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> services, Centralized Logging also
      processes logs for the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HAProxy</li>
      <li>syslog</li>
      <li>keepalived</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="install">
      <title>Installation</title>
      <p>The Centralized Logging feature is automatically installed as part of the <keyword
          keyref="kw-hos"/> installation. The base logging levels will be tuned during installation
        according to the amount of RAM allocated to your control plane nodes to ensure optimum
        performance.</p>
      <p>No specific configuration is required to use Centralized Logging. However, you can tune or
        configure the individual components as needed for your environment as detailed in the <xref
          href="../administration/configure_logging.dita">Configuration the Centralized Logging
          Service</xref> page.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="components">
      <title>Centralized Logging Components</title>
      <p>Centralized logging consists of several components, detailed below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Beaver</b> is a python daemon that takes information in log files and sends the
            content to RabbitMQ.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>RabbitMQ</b> is a message broker for collection of logging data across nodes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>logstash</b> is a log processing system for receiving, processing and outputting
            logs. logstash retrieves logs from RabbitMQ, processes and enriches the data, then
            stores the data in Elasticsearch.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Elasticsearch</b> is a data store offering fast indexing and querying.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Kibana</b> is a client-side JavaScript application to visualize the data in
            Elasticsearch through a web browser. Kibana enables you to create charts and graphs
            using the log data.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Curator</b> is a tool provided by Elasticsearch to manage indices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These components are configured to work out-of-the-box and the admin should be able to view
        log data using the default configurations.</p>
      <p>At a high level, the Helion services forward logs to Beaver. Then, Beaver forwards JSON
        messages to RabbitMQ on the controller0 (management controller) node. Logstash connects to
        RabbitMQ to read queued messages and process the messages according to the Logstash
        configuration file. Logstash then forwards the processed log files in Elasticsearch. Users
        can use the Kibana interface to view and analyze the information, as shown in the following
        figure:</p>
      <p>
        <image href="../../media/centralized_logging_diagram.png" placement="break"/>
      </p>
      <note>The arrows come <b>from</b> the active (requesting) side <b>to</b> the passive
        (listening) side. The active side is always the one providing credentials, so the arrows may
        also be seen as coming from the credential holder to the application requiring
        authentication.</note>
    </section>
    <section id="retaining_logs"><title>Log Retention Information</title>
      <p>The logs that are centrally stored are saved to persistent storage as Elasticsearch
        indices. These indices are stored in the partition <codeph>/var/lib/elasticsearch</codeph>
        on each of the Elasticsearch cluster nodes. Out of the box, each days worth of logs is
        stored in one Elasticsearch index. As days goes by, the number of indices stored in this
        disk partition grows, eventually filling up the partition. Each of these indices takes up
        CPU and memory if they are "open," so if they are left unattended these indices could
        continue to consume system resources and eventually deplete them.</p>
      <p>Elasticsearch, by itself, doesn't prevent this from happening.</p>
      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> uses a tool called "curator" that is developed by the
        Elasticsearch community to handle these situations. <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> ships with an
        hourly cron job that uses curator in conjunction with several configurable settings. This
        cron job does the following checks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First Check - The hourly cron job checks if the current used Elasticsearch partition
          size is over the <codeph>curator_low_watermark_percent</codeph> value. If it is, then
          curator will be run to delete old indices per the
            <codeph>curator_num_of_indices_to_keep</codeph> setting.</li>
        <li>Second Check - Another check is made to verify the partition size is below the high
          watermark percent. If it is still too high, curator will be run again to delete all
          indices except the current one that is over the
            <codeph>curator_max_index_size_in_gb</codeph> size.</li>
        <li>Third Check - A third check is made and if the partition size is still too high, curator
          will be run to delete all indices except the current one.</li>
        <li>Final Check - A final check is made and if the partition size is still high an error
          message is written to the log file but the current index is NOT deleted.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="kibana">
      <title>Kibana Configuration</title>
      <p>You can use the Kibana dashboards to view log data. Kibana is a tool developed to create
        charts, graphs, tables, and histograms based on logs send to Elasticsearch by logstash.</p>
      <p>While creating Kibana dashboards is beyond the scope of this document, it is important to
        know that you can use the default Kibana dashboards or create custom dashboards. The
        dashboards are JSON files that you can modify or create new dashboards based on existing
        dashboards.</p>
      <note>Kibana is client-side software. To operate properly, the browser must be able to access
        port 5601 on the control plane.</note>
    </section>
    <section id="interface">
      <title>Logging into Kibana</title>
      <p>There are two ways to access Kibana:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Through the <b>Logging Dashboard</b> option in the Operations Console</li>
        <li>Direct link via port 5601 on the Horizon VIP address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Details:</p>
      <p><b>Operations Console method</b> - Access the <xref
          href="monitoring_service.dita#monitoring/working" type="section">Operations
        Console</xref>.</p>
      <p>Navigate to the <b>Logging Dashboard</b> via the menu.</p>
      <p><b>Direct Access method</b></p>
      <p>If your administrator set a hostname value for <codeph>external-name</codeph> in your
          <codeph>network_groups.yml</codeph> file during the configuration process for your cloud
        then Kibana will be accessed over port 5601 on that hostname.</p>
      <p>If your administrator did not set a hostname value then in order to determine which IP
        address to use to access Kibana you can use this command from your lifecycle manager
        node:</p>
      <codeblock>grep vip-HZN-WEB /etc/hosts</codeblock>
      <p>The output of that command will show you the virtual IP address for Kibana that you should
        use. Access to Kibana will be over port 5601 of that virtual IP address. Example:</p>
      <codeblock>http://&lt;VIP&gt;:5601</codeblock>
      <p><b>Login Credentials</b></p>
      <p>The default username for Kibana is <codeph>kibana</codeph> and the password is randomized
        during installation. To retrieve it, look in the following directory on your lifecycle
        manager:</p>
      <codeblock>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/group_vars/</codeblock>
      <p>In that directory you will have a file for your control plane node and you will need to
        GREP for the <codeph>logging_kibana_password</codeph>. For example, if you were using the
        Entry-scale KVM with VSA model and you kept the default naming scheme in the example files
        then your command would look similar to this:</p>
      <codeblock>grep logging_kibana_password entry-scale-kvm-vsa-control-plane-1</codeblock>
    </section>
    <section id="troubleshooting"><title>Using Centralized Logging to Troubleshoot Issues</title>
      <p>You can troubleshoot service-specific issues by reviewing the logs. After logging into
        Kibana, follow these steps to load the logs for viewing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the <b>Settings</b> menu to configure an index pattern to search for.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Index name or pattern</b> field, you can enter <codeph>logstash-*</codeph> to
          query all elasticsearch indices.</li>
        <li>Click the green <b>Create</b> button to create and load the index.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the <b>Discover</b> menu to load the index and make it available to
          search.</li>
      </ol>
      <note>If you want to search specific elasticsearch indices, you can run <codeph>curl
          localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v</codeph> from the control plane to get a full list of
        available indices.</note>
      <p>Once the logs load you can change the timeframe from the dropdown in the upper-righthand
        corner of the Kibana window. You have the following options to choose from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quick - a variety of time frame choices will be available here</li>
        <li>Relative - allows you to select a start time relative to the current time to show this
          range</li>
        <li>Absolute - allows you to select a date range to query</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When searching there are common fields you will want to use, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>type - this will include the service name, such as <codeph>keystone</codeph> or
            <codeph>ceilometer</codeph></li>
        <li>host - you can specify a specific host to search for in the logs</li>
        <li>file - you can specify a specific log file to search</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For more details on using Kibana and Elasticsearch to query logs, see <xref

    <section id="monitoring"><title>Monitoring Centralized Logging</title>
      <p>To help keep abreast of potential logging issues and resolve issues before they affect
        logging, you may wish to monitor the Centralized Logging Alarms. To do so:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to the Operations Console GUI</li>
        <li>Navigate to the Alarm Definitions page from the menu button in the upper left
          corner</li>
        <li>Find the alarm definitions that are applied to the various hosts. See the <xref
            href="alarms.dita#alarmdefinitions/logging">Logging Alarm Definitions List</xref> for
          the Centralized Logging Alarm Definitions.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the Alarms page</li>
        <li>Find the alarm definitions applied to the various hosts. These should match the alarm
          definitions in the <xref href="alarms.dita#alarmdefinitions/logging">Logging Alarm
            Definitions List</xref>.</li>
        <li>See if the alarm is green (good) or is in a bad state. If any are in a bad state, see
          the possible actions to perform in the <xref href="alarms.dita#alarmdefinitions/logging"
            >Logging Alarms Definitions List</xref>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can use this filtering technique in the "Alarms" page to look for the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To look for Processes that may be down, filter for "Process" then make sure the process
          are up: <ol>
            <li>Elasticsearch</li>
            <li>Logstash</li>
            <li>RabbitMQ</li>
            <li>Beaver</li>
            <li>Apache</li>
          </ol></li>
      </ol>
      <p>To look for sufficient Disk space, filter for "Disk"</p>
      <p>To look for sufficient RAM Memory, filter for "Memory"</p>
