    <section id="about">
      <p>The Operations Console (Ops Console) for <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> is designed for
          <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Administrators to have a web-based UI they can use to view data
        about their cloud infrastructure. The Ops Console is a web-based GUI that offers the user
        access to data such as monitoring alarms data by service, performance data, compute nodes
        and instances lists, and a drilldown to Kibana for a deep look into logs. The Business Logic
        Layer is a middleware component that serves as a single point of contact for the UI to
        communicate with OpenStack services such as Monasca, Nova, and others.</p>
      <p>The operations console processes use a message queue while processing requests from the web browser. 
        There are two options for the technology used for this message queue: Apache Kafka (the default) and RabbitMQ. 
        The advatage of using either of these options is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The advantages of using Apache Kafka include its architecture that is optimized for high performance 
         and reliability, and the fact that it is isolated from the RabbitMQ messaging system that is being monitored 
         by Monasca and displayed in the Operations Console. This allows the Operations Console to work even when 
         RabbitMQ has issues, which can be useful to help resolve the RabbitMQ issues.</li>
        <li>The main advantage of RabbitMQ is that it is requires credentials in order to connect and to send and receive 
          messages. Regardless of the message queue system, the Operations Console encrypts all messages using AES-CBC.
          Since Kafka does not require credentials to interact with it, it is recommended to avoid re-configuring Kafka 
          to listen on publicly accessible ports or to disable encryption. The encryption key and RabbitMQ credentials 
          are generated randomly and stored in the Operations Console configuration file.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="connecting">
      <p>If your administrator set a hostname value for <codeph>external_name</codeph> in your
          <codeph>network_groups.yml</codeph> file during the configuration process for your cloud
        then the Operations Console will be accessed over port 9095 on that hostname.</p>
      <p>If your administrator did not set a hostname value then in order to determine which IP
        address to use to access Horizon you can use this command from your lifecycle manager:
        <codeblock>grep vip-HZN-WEB /etc/hosts</codeblock></p>
      <p>The output of that command will show you the virtual IP address you should use. It is
        listening over port 9095 on that virtual IP address, so you can use the following syntax to
        access it:<codeblock>http://VIP:9095</codeblock></p>
      <p>The default username for the Administrator user is <codeph>admin</codeph>. In order to find
        the randomized password that is created for this user you will need to look into the
          <codeph>~/service.osrc</codeph> file on the lifecycle manager. You can do that with this
        command:</p>
      <codeblock>cat ~/service.osrc</codeblock>

    <section id="help"><title>Getting Help</title>
      <p>On each of the Operations Console pages there is a help menu that you can click on to take
        you to a help page specific to the console you are currently viewing.</p>
      <p>To reach the help page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the help menu option in the upper-right corner of the page, depicted by the
          question mark seen in the screenshot below.</li>
        <li>Click on the <uicontrol>Get Help For This Page</uicontrol> link which will open the help
          page in a new tab in your browser.</li>
