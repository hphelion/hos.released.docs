      <p>You can use the Operations Console (Ops Console) for <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> to
        view data about your Helion cloud infrastructure in a web-based graphical user interface
        (GUI) to make sure your cloud is operating correctly. By logging on to the console, <keyword
          keyref="kw-hos"/> administrators can manage data in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Triage alarm notifications in the central dashboard</li>
        <li>Monitor the environment by giving priority to alarms that take precedence</li>
        <li>Manage compute nodes and easily use a form to create a new host</li>
        <li>Refine the monitoring environment by creating new alarms to specify a combination of
          metrics, services, and hosts that match the triggers unique to an environment</li>
        <li>Plan for future storage by tracking capacity over time to predict with some degree of
          reliability the amount of additional storage needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Business Logic Layer of Ops Console is a middleware component that serves as a single
        point of contact for the user interface to communicate with OpenStack services such as
        Monasca, Nova, and others.</p>

      <title>Connecting to the Operations Console</title>
      <p>To connect to OpsConsole you will need to understand the following tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><xref type="section" href="#opsconsole/access_creds">Ensure your login has the required
            access credentials</xref></li>

      <title>Required Access Credentials</title>
      <p>In previous versions of OpsConsole you were required to have only the password for the
        Administrator account (admin by default). Now the Administrator user account must also have
        all of the following credentials:</p>

      <note type="important"> If your login account has administrator role on the administrator

      <p><b>Administrator account</b></p>
      <p>During installation, an Administrator account called “admin” is created default.</p>
      <p><b>Administrator password</b></p>
      <p>During installation, an Administrator password is randomly created by default. It is not
        recommend that you change the default password.</p>
      <p>To find the randomized password:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To display the password, log on to the lifecycle manager and run:
          <codeblock>cat ~/service.osrc</codeblock></li>

    <section id="command">
      <title>Connect Through a Browser</title>
      <p>The following instructions will show you how to find the URL to access Ops Console. You
        will use SSH, also known as Secure Socket Shell, which provides administrators with a secure
        way to access a remote computer.</p>
      <p><b>To access OpsConsole:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>To log on to the lifecycle manager (deployer node), run:
          <codeblock>  $ ssh &lt;lifecycle manager&gt;</codeblock></li>
        <li>To find the URL, run: <codeblock>$ . ~/service.osrc &amp;&amp; openstack endpoint list | grep opsconsole | grep public</codeblock>
          <b>Sample output:</b>
          <codeblock>| eec0d2c02d9341db8e535b8dea561d6a | region1 | opsconsole | opsconsole | True | public | https://myhelion.test:9095/api/v1/</codeblock></li>
        <li>To access Ops Console, in the sample output, remove everything after port 9095 and in a
          browser, type: <codeblock>https://myhelion.test:9095</codeblock></li>
      </ol>

    <section id="find_nameIP">
      <title>Optionally use a Hostname OR virtual IP address to access Ops Console</title>
      <note type="important">If you can access Ops Console using the above instructions, then you
        can skip this section. These steps provide an alernate way to access Ops Console if the
        above steps do not work for you.</note>
      <p>To find your hostname OR IP address:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to and open in a text editor the following file:
          <codeblock>network_groups.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Find the following entry: <codeblock>external-name</codeblock></li>
        <li>If your administrator set a hostname value in the external-name field, you will use that
          hostname when logging in to OpsConsole. or example, in a browser you would type:
          <codeblock>https://VIP:9095</codeblock></li>
        <li>If your administrator did not set a hostname value, then to determine the IP address to
          use, from your lifecycle manager, run: <codeblock>Grep vip -HZN-WEB /etc/hosts</codeblock>
          The output of that command will show you the virtual IP address you should use. For
          example, in a browser you would type: <codeblock>https://VIP:9095</codeblock>
