      <b>Domains</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Domains can be created and managed by the Horizon web interface, Keystone API and
          OpenStackClient CLI.</li>

        <li>The configuration of external authentication systems requires the creation and usage of
          Domains.</li>
        <li>All configurations are managed by creating and editing specific configuration files. </li>
        <li>End users can authenticate to a particular project and domain via the Horizon web
          interface, Keystone API and OpenStackClient CLI.</li>
        <li>A new Horizon login page that requires a Domain entry is now installed by default.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Keystone-to-Keystone Federation</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Keystone-to-Keystone (K2K) Federation provides the ability to authenticate once with one
          cloud and then use these credentials to access resources on other federated clouds.</li>
        <li>All configurations are managed by creating and editing specific configuration files.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The Keystone architecture provides support for MFA deployments.</li>
        <li>MFA provides the ability to deploy non-password based authentication; for example: token
          providing hardware and text messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Hierarchical Multitenancy</b>
      <ul>

        <li>Provides the ability to create sub-projects within a Domain-Project hierarchy.</li>


      </ul>

        Directory (AD) or Identity Providers)</b><ul id="ul_u52_jpd_bt">
        <li>No Horizon web portal support currently exists for the creation and management of
          external authentication system configurations.</li>

          currently an "experimental" function and is not recommended for production use until a

      <b>Missing quota information for compute resources</b>
      <p>
        <note>An error message that will appear in the default Horizon page if you are running a
          Swift-only deployment (no Compute service). In this configuration, you will not see any
          quota information for Compute resources and will see the following error message: </note>
      </p>
      <p><i>The Compute service is not installed or is not configured properly. No information is
          available for Compute resources.</i></p>
      <p>This error message is expected as no Compute service is configured for this deployment.
        Please ignore the error message.</p>
