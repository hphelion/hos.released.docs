    <section><title>Updating the Keystone Identity Service</title><p>This topic explains
        configuration options for the Identity Service. </p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> allows you to
      perform updates on the following parts of the Identity service configuration:</section>
      
    <section>
      
      <ul>
      <li> Any content in main keystone configuration file:<b> /etc/keystone/keystone.conf</b>. This
          allows to manipulate Keystone configuration parameters. Please refer to the <xref
            href="#topic_m43_2j3_bt/updating" format="dita">Updating the main Identity Service
            configuration file</xref> section next. </li><li>Updating certain configuration options and enabling features, such as:
      
      
      <ul><li>Verbosity of logs being written to keystone log files.
      </li><li>Process counts for Apache2 WSGI module, separately for admin and public Keystone interfaces
      </li><li>Enabling/disabling auditing.
      </li><li>Enabling/disabling Fernet Tokens.</li></ul>
      
      Please refer to Enabling Keystone Features section below.</li>
      <li>Creating and updating domain-specific configuration files:
            <b>/etc/keystone/domains/keystone.&lt;domain_name>.conf</b>. This allows to integrate
          Keystone with one or more external authentication sources, such as LDAP server. Please
          refer to Integrating with an external LDAP server section below. </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="updating">
      <title>Updating the main Identity Service configuration file</title>
      
     <ol><li>The main Keystone Identity Service configuration file (<b>/etc/keystone/keystone.conf</b>),
          located on each control plane server is generated from the following template file located
          on a lifecycle manager: <b>/home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone.conf.j2</b>
          <p>Modify this template file as appropriate. Please refer to <xref
              href="http://docs.openstack.org/liberty/config-reference/content/keystone-configuration-file.html"
              format="html" scope="external">Keystone Liberty documentation</xref> for full
            descriptions of all settings: This is a Jinja2 template, which expects certain template
            variables to be set. Do not change values inside double curly braces: {{ }}. </p>
       <note><p><keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> has the token expiration setting as below, which is
            different from the upstream value "3600":</p>
            <codeblock>[token] 
expiration = 14400</codeblock></note>
        </li>
    <li>Once the template is modified, commit the change to the local git repository, and rerun the
          configuration processor / deployment area preparation playbooks (as suggested at <xref
            href="../../../installation/using_git.dita">Using Git for Configuration Management</xref>):
          <codeblock>$ cd ~/helion
$ git checkout site
$ git add my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone.conf.j2
$ git commit -m "Adjusting some parameters in keystone.conf"
$ cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock></li>
       <li>Run reconfiguration playbook in deployment area:
          <codeblock>$ cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts keystone-reconfigure.yml</codeblock>
        </li></ol>

    <section id="enable_features"><title>Enabling Identity Service features</title> To enable or
      disable Keystone features like Fernet Tokens, do the following: <ol>

    <section><title>Fernet Token</title>
      
      
      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> supports UUID tokens by default. Fernet Tokens are available as an
        experimental feature. You can switch to using Fernet tokens instead of UUID tokens by
        following the above steps. The benefit of using Fernet tokens is that tokens are not
        persisted in a database, which is helpful if you want to deploy Keystone Identity service as
        one master and multiple slaves: only roles, projects, etc. will need to be replicated from
        master to slaves, not the token table. The tradeoff is the cost of token validation.
        According to our performance testing, although Fernet tokens perform slightly better than
        UUID on token creation, the degradation is about 400% on token validation when compared to
        UUID tokens. The performance degradation is caused mainly by database operations; there are
        39 queries per fernet token validation, while UUID causes only 2 queries per token
        validation.</p>
      
      <note>Tempest doesn't work with Fernet Tokens in <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>. If Fernet tokens are
        enabled, please don't run token tests in Tempest.</note>
      
      <note>During reconfiguration when switching to a Fernet token provider or during Fernet key
        rotation, you may see a warning in keystone.log stating "[fernet_tokens] key_repository is
        world readable: /etc/keystone/fernet-keys/". This is expected. You can safely ignore the
        message. For other Keystone operations, you won't see this warning. The directory
        permissions are actually set to 600 (read/write by owner only), not world readable.</note>
