    <p>All of these playbooks will be run from the lifecycle manager from the
        <codeph>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible</codeph> directory.</p>

            <entry>There are two steps in this playbook:<ul id="ul_smp_ygy_4t">
                <li>Make delta<p>It processes the input model and compares it against the existing
                    rings. After comparison, it produces a list of differences between the input
                    model and the existing rings. This is called the ring delta. The ring delta
                    covers drives being added, drives being removed, weight changes, and replica
                    count changes.</p></li>
              </ul><ul id="ul_xbm_2hy_4t">
                <li>Rebalance<p>The ring delta is then converted into a series of commands (such as
                      <codeph>add</codeph>) to the swift-ring-builder program. Finally, the
                      <codeph>rebalance</codeph> command is issued to the swift-ring-builder
                    program.</p></li>
              </ul></entry>
            <entry>This playbook performs its actions on the first node running the swift-proxy
              service. (For more information, see <xref
                href="../troubleshooting/objectstorage/first_proxy_server.dita"/>.) However, it also
              scans all Swift nodes to find the size of disk drives.<p>If there are no changes in
                the ring delta, the <codeph>rebalance</codeph> command is still executed to
                rebalance the rings. If <codeph>min-part-time</codeph> has not yet elapsed or if no
                partitions need to be moved, new rings are not written.</p></entry>

            <entry>There are two steps in this playbook:<ul id="ul_qc2_b3y_4t">
                <li>Make delta<p>This is the same as described for
                      <codeph>swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml</codeph>.</p></li>
              </ul><ul id="ul_ht2_f3y_4t">
                <li>Report<p>This prints a summary of the proposed changes that will be made to the
                    rings (i.e., what would happen if you rebalanced).</p></li>
              </ul><p>The playbook reports any issues or problems it finds with the input
                model.</p><p>This playbook can be useful to confirm that there are no errors in the
                input model. It also allows you to check that when you change the input model, that
                the proposed ring changes are as expected. For example, if you have added a server
                to the input model, but this playbook reports that no drives are being added, you
                should determine the cause.</p></entry>

            <entry><codeph>swift-deploy.yml</codeph> is responsible for installing software and
              configuring Swift on nodes. As part of installing and configuring, it runs the
                <codeph>_swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml</codeph> and
                <codeph>swift-reconfigure.yml</codeph> playbooks.</entry>
            <entry>This playbook is included in the <codeph>hlm-deploy.yml</codeph> and
                <codeph>site.yml</codeph> playbooks, so if you run either of those playbooks, the

              <p><codeph>swift-reconfigure.yml</codeph> takes rings that the

                those rings to all Swift nodes.</p>

            <entry>Every time that you directly use the
                <codeph>_swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml</codeph> playbook, you must copy these rings
              to the system using the <codeph>swift-reconfigure.yml</codeph> playbook. If you forget
              and run <codeph>_swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml</codeph> twice, the process may move
              two replicates of some partitions at the same time.</entry>
