    <p>You can use this guide to help you identify and resolve basic problems you may be
      experiencing while deploying Swift service. It contains the following troubleshooting
      scenarios:</p>

        <!--<title><b>Resetting Builder Files</b></title><p/><p>WARNING: this process should only be used during the initial deployment process when you want to restart a deploy from scratch. If you use this process after the initial deploy is complete, you risk loosing critical system data</p><p>The structure of a ring is built in incremental stages. When you modify a ring, the new ring is uses the state of the old ring as a basis for the new ring. This state is kept in a file called the builder file. The swiftlm-ring-supervisor stores builder files in the /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir directory/ on the Ring-Builder node.The builder files are named &lt;ring-name&gt;.builder. Prior versions of the builder files are stored in the /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/backups directory.</p><p>Normally, you would use an existing builder file as the basis for changes to a ring. However, when creating a ring from scratch, no builder file exists. Instead, the first step in the process is to build a builder file. The swiftlm-ring-supervisor does this for you as part of the deployment process. However, if the Cloud Model contains errors, you may wish to start from scratch. When swiftlm-ring-supervisor finds existing builder files it assumes you are <i>modifying</i> a ring and will behave differently than when it is creating a ring from scratch. To start from scratch, follow this process:</p><ul id="ul_zhk_24l_ht"><li>You must know your Keystone region name. Each distinct Swift system uses a different Keystone region. If you have several Keystone regions and you are trying to return to the start state for region2, you do not want to delete the builder files of region1 as this is presumably running normally).</li><li><p>Delete the builder files in the /etc/swiftlm/builder-dir/region-&lt;region-name&gt;/ directory. For example, for the region2 Keystone region, use this command:<codeblock>sudo rm /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-region2/*.builder</codeblock></p><p>Note: If you have successfully deployed a system and accidentally delete the builder files, you can recover to the correct state using Recovering Builder Files process.</p></li></ul>--></p>
