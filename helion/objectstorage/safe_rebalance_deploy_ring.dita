    New Ring</title>
  <body>
    <p conkeyref="HOS-conrefs/applies-to-all"/>
    <p>Before deploying a new ring, you must be sure the change that has been applied to the last
      ring is complete (i.e., all the partitions are in their correct location). There are three
      aspects to this:</p>
    <ul id="ul_dnm_m1t_4t">
      <li>
        <p>Is the replication system busy? </p>
        <p>You might want to postpone a ring change until after replication has finished. If the
          replication system is busy repairing a failed drive, a ring change will place additional
          load on the system. To check that replication has finished, use the
            <codeph>swift-recon</codeph> command with the <b>--replication</b> argument. (For more
          information, see <xref href="validating_swift_recon.dita"/>.) The oldest completion time
          can indicate that the replication process is very busy. If it is more than 15 or 20
          minutes then the object replication process are probably still very busy. The following
          example indicates that the oldest completion is 120 seconds, so that the replication
          process is probably not
          busy:<codeblock>$ sudo swift-recon --replication

        <li>
          <p>Are there drive or server failures? </p>
          <p>A drive failure does not preclude deploying a new ring. In principal, there should be
            two copies elsewhere. However, another drive failure in the middle of replication might
            make data temporary unavailable. If possible, postpone ring changes until all servers
            and drives are operating normally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Has <codeph>min-part-time</codeph> elapsed? <p>The <codeph>swift-ring-builder</codeph>
            will refuse to build a new ring until <codeph>min-part-time</codeph> hours has elapsed
            since the last time it built rings. You must postpone changes until this time has
            elapsed. Alternatively you can change the value of min-part-time. (For instructions, see
              <xref href="how_to_change_min_part_time.dita#topic_ybt_mhb_kt"/>).</p></li>
