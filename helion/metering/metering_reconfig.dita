  <body><!--not tested-->
    <p conkeyref="HOS-conrefs/applies-to"/>
    <section id="deploy"><title>Deployment</title> <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> automatically deploys
      Ceilometer to use the shared MySQL database along with other OpenStack services such as
      Keystone. Ceilometer is configured to use a common MySQL database and deployed on the same
      control plane nodes along with other OpenStack services such as Keystone, Nova, Neutron,
      Glance, Swift etc. </section>

    <section id="apache"><title>Configure Apache2 for the Ceilometer API</title> The first step to
      execute is to add the <b>ceilometer_modwsgi.conf </b>file in the /etc/apache2/sites-available
      folder. The <b>ceilometer_modwsgi.conf</b> should have added the
      following:<codeblock>Listen &lt;ipaddress>:8777 
&lt;VirtualHost *:8777>
  WSGIScriptAlias / /opt/stack/service/ceilometer-api-20151021T030442Z/venv/bin/../lib/python2.7/site-packages/ceilometer/api/app.wsgi

&lt;/VirtualHost>&lt;/ipaddress></codeblock>
      The Ceilometer APIs are running as WSGI processes. Each process can have a certain number of
      threads taking care of the filters and applications comprising the processing pipeline. This
      file is configured during <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> deployment and preferably should be changed by
      running the <b>ceilometer-reconfigure.yml</b> playbook (see the <xref
        href="#reconfig_metering/reconfig" format="dita">Reconfigure</xref> section below). This
      configuration refers to the installed Ceilometer API version and needs to be referenced
      appropriately based on the version installed and needs to be used. The main parameters that
      can be altered to increase the responsiveness is processes and threads in the above mentioned
      config file. <note><p>WSGIDaemon Recommended Settings The best, and hence, recommended
        configuration is to have four processes running in parallel: Recommended number of processes
        to be set in <b>ceilometer.conf </b><codeblock>processes=4</codeblock> and for each process,
        a maximum of 5 threads: Recommended number of threads per process</p>
        <codeblock>threads=5</codeblock></note>
    </section>


    <section id="softlink"><title>Add softlink for config file</title> Next, create/add a softlink
      for the <b>ceilometer_modwsgi.conf</b> in the<b> /etc/apache2/sites-enabled</b> folder. Add
      softlink to celiometer.conf
      <codeblock>ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/ceilometer_modwsgi.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled</codeblock>
      or alternatively you can run <codeblock>a2ensite ceilometer_modwsgi.conf  </codeblock>
    </section>


    <section id="apachereload"><title>Reload Apache2</title>
      <p> For the changes to take effect, the apache2 service needs to be reloaded. This ensures
        that all the configuration changes are considered and the service has applied them. The
        system administrator can change the configuration of processes and threads and experiment if
        alternative settings if necessary.</p> The command to reload the apache2 service is the
      following: <codeblock>sudo service apache2 reload</codeblock>
    </section>

    <section id="verify"><title>Verification</title> Once the Apache2 service has been reloaded it
      will be possible to test that the Ceilometer APIs are running and able to receive incoming
      traffic. The Ceilometer APIs listen on port 8777. Verification can be performed using the
      following command to get Apache2 with Ceilometer running instances :
      <codeblock>ps -ef | grep apache </codeblock> This should generate an output similar to the one
      below if everything is in order:
      <codeblock>ceilome+ 31430 31427 10 16:29 ? 00:02:40 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
ceilome+ 31431 31427 10 16:29 ? 00:02:41 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
ceilome+ 31432 31427 10 16:29 ? 00:02:42 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
ceilome+ 31433 31427 10 16:29 ? 00:02:43 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start </codeblock>
      The list of entries in the above output SHOULD match the number of processors set in the
      configuration file, in the recommended case 4. Also it is possible to verify that Apache2 is
      accepting incoming traffic on port 8777: <codeblock>netstat -tulpn | grep 8777 </codeblock>
      This should produce the following output:
      <codeblock>tcp6 0 0 :::8777 :::* LISTEN 8959/apache2 </codeblock> If Ceilometer fails to
      deploy, check the proxy setting, and unset https_proxy http_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY </section>

    <section id="metering_services"><title>Enabling Services for Messaging Notifications</title>
      Nova, Cinder, Glance, Neutron and Swift are already enabled to send notifications out of the
      box in <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>. The list of meters supported out of the box for these services
      are listed in the Notification Agent or Central Agent's pipeline configuration. </section>

    <section id="upgrade">
      <title>Upgrade</title> Follow Standard Service upgrade mechanism available in the
      lifecycle manager distribution. For Ceilometer, the playbook included with <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>
      is ceilometer-upgrade.yml </section>


    <section id="reconfig"><title>Reconfigure</title> Make changes in the Ceilometer available
      configuration files on lifecycle manager machine in
        <codeph>/home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/ceilometer/</codeph>
