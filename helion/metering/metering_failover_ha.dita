    Support</title>
  <body><!--not tested-->
    <p conkeyref="HOS-conrefs/applies-to"/>
    <section> In the <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> environment, the Ceilometer metering service
      supports native Active-Active high-availability (HA) for the notification agent and central
      agent. Agent HA support includes workload-balancing, workload-distribution and failover.
        <p>Tooz is the coordination engine that is used to coordinate workload among multiple active
        agent instances. It also maintains the knowledge of active instance to handle failover and
        group membership using hearbeats (pings).</p><p>Zookeeper is used as the coordination
        backend. Zookeeper uses Tooz to expose the APIs that manage group membership and retrieve
        workload specific to each agent.</p><p>The following section in conf is used to configure
        high-availability (HA):</p>
      <codeblock>[coordination]
      
backend_url = &lt;IP address of Zookeeper host: port> (port is usually 2181 as a zookeeper default)
        
heartbeat = 1.0
        
check_watchers = 10.0</codeblock>
      <p>For the notification agent to be configured in HA mode, additional configuration is
        needed:</p>
      <codeblock>[notification]
        
workload_partitioning = true</codeblock>
      <p>The notification agent HA distributes workload among multiple queues that are created based
        on the number of unique source:sink combinations in the notification agent pipeline
        configuration file. If there are additional services to be metered using notifications, then
        the recommendation is to use a separate source for those events, especially if the expected
        load of data from that source is considered high. This should lead to better workload
        balancing among multiple active notification agents.</p>
      <p>Ceilometer-expirer is also Active-Active HA, but it is critical that you ensure that a
        single expirer process runs when multiple processes are scheduled to run at the same time
        (using cron-based scheduling) on multiple controller nodes. Tooz is used to pick an expirer
        process that acquires a lock when there are multiple contenders and the winning process
        runs. There is no failover support, as expirer is not a daemon anyway and is scheduled to
        run at pre-determined intervals. The following configuration is needed to enable expirer
        HA:</p>
      <codeblock>[database] expirer_ha = true 
expirer_ha_backend_url = &lt;IP address of coordination backend url></codeblock>
