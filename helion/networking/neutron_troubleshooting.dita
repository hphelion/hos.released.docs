      <b>Split-brain result of failover of L3 agent when master comes back up</b>
      This situation is specific to when L3 HA is configured and a network failure occurs to the node hosting the currently active l3 agent. 
      L3 HA is intended to provide HA in situations where the l3-agent crashes or the node hosting an l3-agent crashes/restarts. In the case
      of a physical networking issue which isolates the active l3 agent, the stand-by l3-agent takes over but when the physical networking issue is resolved,
      traffic to the VMs is disrupted due to a "split-brain" situation in which traffic is split over the two L3 agents. The solution is to restart the L3-agent that was originally the master.
