    <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Networking is a virtual networking service that leverages the OpenStack
      Neutron service to provide network connectivity and addressing to <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Compute
      service devices.</p>
    <p>The Networking service also provides an API to configure and manage a variety of network
      services.</p>
    <p>You can use the Networking service to connect guest servers or you can define and configure
      your own virtual network topology.</p>
    <section><title>Network Separation in Neutron</title><p>Network separation is the name given to the practice of segregating network traffic by types. The
        primary reasons to employ network separation are to increase performance and security.
        Having a dedicated channel enables a network administrator to exercise better control over
        the SLA provided to the tenant. Network separation is often implemented as part of a
        security policy that is enforced by the security practices in the organization.</p>
      <p> There are two types of network separation: physical and logical. Both are the same in that
        they create separate channels for traffic types. For example, a best practice is to create
        separate channel for storage (iSCSI) traffic. This can be accomplished by creating a logical
        separation using VLAN on a single network interface card (NIC) or by dedicating a NIC for
        this type of traffic. In the cloud today, management, tenant, external and services traffic
        types are segregated into their own channels.</p>

    <section><title>Multiple Networks</title>
 <p>
      
      The multiple networks feature in HPE Helion OpenStack enables bridging of 
      multiple external physical networks to Neutron network. Using this functionality, 
      a tenant can dictate the path taken by the data in the physical network outside the cloud.
      It can also be used for multihoming to two physical networks.

    <p>You can also use the Networking service to identify the actual IP address of a malicious
      user, if you know the user's NAT address. For more information, see <xref

      <title>Reconfiguring the Networking service</title>
      <p>If you change any of the network configuration after installation, it is recommended that
        you reconfigure the Networking service by running the neutron-reconfigure playbook.</p>
      <p>On the lifecycle manager:</p>
      <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hlm/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts neutron-reconfigure.yml</codeblock>
