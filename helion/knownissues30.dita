                been changed, although the location of the file remains the same:</p>
            <p>Old name/location: <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/config/nova/policy.json</codeph></p>
            <p>New name/location:
                <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/config/nova/policy.json.j2</codeph></p>
            <p>If you have made changes to this file in your environment, you should recreate

            <p><!-- DOCS-2513 --> There will be performance degradation to a user's account in
                your cloud environment if the number of roles assigned to that user goes above
                ~1000. You are advised to use the user account functionality in an efficient way
                so that this does not become an issue. This was reported in upstream OpenStack
                <xref href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1499555"
