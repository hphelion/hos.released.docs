  <body>
    <p>HotPools are initialized, unconfigured MySQL database instances used to speed up database creation. When a 
      user creates a MySQL database instance, if there is a HotPool instance available of the desired flavor, that 
      instance is used and configured, instead of creating a new instance. Having an instance already initialized
      saves 60 to 75 percent of the time needed to create a new instance.</p>
    <p>HotPools provide a resource vs. performance tradeoff; in order to speed instance creation, resources are allocated to keep instances running and available. HotPools
    should only be used if speeding up instance creation is necessary.</p>
    <note>HotPools are only available for MySQL instances; HotPools for Vertica Preview, MongoDB, and Redis
    are not available.</note>
    <note>HotPools can only be configured when the Database Service is installed; there is currently no method for modifying HotPools configuration post-installation.</note>
    <section id="enable"><title>Enabling and configuring HotPools</title>
      <p>HotPools are enabled and configured using <b>clouds.yaml</b>. The following settings are
        used to configure HotPools:</p>
        <ul><li><b>hotpools_enabled</b>: Set to <b>True</b> to enable HotPools.</li>
        <li><b>hotpools_max_instances</b>: The number of instances of each flavor to maintain.</li>
        <li><b>hotpools_image_name</b>: The image used to create the HotPool instances. The only valid value is <b>percona</b>.</li>
        <li><b>hotpools_flavor_names</b>: A comma-delimited list of the flavors of HotPool instances to create.</li></ul>
      <p><b>Example 1:</b> Create three instances of flavor <b>m1.medium</b>:</p>
      <codeblock>clouds:
  mycloud:
    database:
      hotpools_enabled: True
      hotpools_max_instances: 3
      hotpools_image_name: percona
      hotpools_flavor_names: 'm1.medium'</codeblock>
    <p><b>Example 2:</b> Create two instances each of flavor <b>m1.medium</b> and <b>m1.large</b>:</p>
      <codeblock>clouds:
  mycloud:
    database:
      hotpools_enabled: True
      hotpools_max_instances: 2
      hotpools_image_name: percona
      hotpools_flavor_names: 'm1.medium,m1.large'</codeblock>
    </section>
    <section id="details"><title>Details</title>
    <p>When HotPools instances are created, they are assigned to one tenant. They will appear as instances named <codeph>hot_pools</codeph> when listed using <codeph>nova list</codeph>.
    When an instance is created, and there is a HotPools instance available of the correct flavor, the HotPools instance will be renamed <codeph>hot_pools_&lt;yourinstance&gt;</codeph> 
      while it is being configured. A new HotPools instance will then start to spawn.</p></section>
